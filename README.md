# Decoding Hospital Stays: A Data-Driven Analysis - Python Project in Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview:
Decoding Hospital Stays is an independent Data Analysis project focused on using Python to explore and analyze hospital length of stay data, aiming to answer various questions related to the length of hospital stays. The dataset used for this analysis can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/drscarlat/predict-hospital-length-of-stay-classification).

## Data:
The dataset used for this project consists of information related to hospital stays, including variables such as age, severity of illness, number of visitors, availability of extra rooms, bed grade, department, and length of stay.

## Questions Explored:
### Trends and Descriptive Analysis:
1. What is the distribution of length of stay in hospitals?
2. How does the length of stay vary across different hospitals and regions?
3. How does the severity of illness influence the length of stay?

### Correlations and Relationships:
4. Is there a correlation between the number of visitors and the length of stay?
5. Does the availability of extra rooms affect the length of stay for patients?
6. How does the bed grade impact the length of stay?
7. Are certain departments associated with longer or shorter lengths of stay?

### Age Analysis:
8. How does the age of the patient influence the length of stay?

## Methods:
* Utilized Python for comprehensive data cleaning and transformation tasksÂ to ensure the dataset was well-prepared for analysis.
* Employed NumPy and Pandas Libraries to write complex functions, making data manipulation and transformation processes more efficient.
* Wrote custom Python functions to transform and standardize the data, streamlining data processing and ensuring consistency.
* Used aggregation and grouping to make calculations, and effectively organize and visualize data, providing valuable insights.
* Created pivot tables to generate readable and effective visuals and charts of the data, contributing to a clearer understanding of dataset trends and patterns.

## Conclusion:
The analysis of the hospital length of stay data provided valuable insights into factors influencing the duration of hospitalization. Key findings include:
- The severity of illness is directly related to the length of stay.
- A higher number of visitors is correlated with a longer length of stay.
- Having more available rooms than average correlates with a shorter length of stay.
- Grade 1 beds correlate with the lowest average length of stay.
- Certain departments are associated with longer or shorter lengths of stay.
- Older age is directly related to longer hospital stays.

## Python Versions and Library Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
